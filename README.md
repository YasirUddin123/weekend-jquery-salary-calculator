# Salary Calculator Application (jQuery)

## Purpose

In this project, my goal is to create an application that records employee salaries and adds salaries up to report monthly costs using JavaScript and jQuery (selectors, append, and event handling).

## Description

Input fields are embedded on the application to collect employee information. It includes a 'Submit' button to collect the information, stores the information to calculate monthly costs, append the calculations to the DOM and clear the input fields.

If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, a red background color will appear to the total monthly cost.

On the application, there is a delete button that removes an employee from the DOM. In my first iteration of this application, this button does NOT remove that employee's salary from the reported total.

## High-Level Development Plan

1. Source our .js and .css files.
2. Write HTML that will be a rough "placeholder" of what our app will look like.
3. Use jQuery to append hardcoded "employee item" data to the DOM.
4. Wire up the add employee functionality.
5. Wire up the calculate monthly total functionality.
